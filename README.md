# Customer Churn Prediction Project

![Churn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Churn%20Prediction-Project%20Template-blue)

This repository contains a customer churn prediction project, where we aim to predict whether a customer will churn or not from a company's products or services. Customer churn is a critical business metric that directly impacts revenue and growth. By analyzing historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we can develop a predictive model to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

## About

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. This project focuses on understanding churn behavior and predicting potential churners to help businesses improve customer retention and satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about customers and their interactions with the company's products or services. Each record in the dataset includes features that provide insights into customer behavior, such as usage patterns, engagement metrics, and demographic information. The target variable is the 'Churn' label, which indicates whether a customer has churned or not.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized machine learning techniques to predict customer churn.
- Developed a predictive model based on historical data.
- Analyzed key features contributing to customer churn.
- Provided insights to help businesses improve customer retention strategies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the churn prediction script:

```bash
python predict_churn.py
```

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the churn prediction model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to predict customer churn effectively.
